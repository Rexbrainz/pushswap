# pushswap
The aim of this project is to sort a number of integers using the following rules:
• You have 2 stacks named a and b.
• At the beginning:
◦ The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated.
◦ The stack b is empty.
• The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:
sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
Do nothing if b is empty.
pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
Do nothing if a is empty.
ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.
rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

Benchmark:
To validate this project, you must perform certain sorts with a minimal number of operations:
• For a minimalist validation (that implies a minimal grade of 80), you must be
able to sort 100 random numbers in fewer than 700 operations.
• For maximal project validation and thus to be able to achieve the bonuses, you
must fulfill the first step above, but also for 500 random numbers, there should
be no more than 5500 operations.
